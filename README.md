---

## 🎯 Project Overview
This project provides a data-backed staffing recommendation for a medical agency during the US influenza season. The goal is to ensure that temporary medical personnel are deployed to the right states at the right time, minimizing hospital strain and improving patient care.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technical Skills
* **Analysis:** Microsoft Excel (Data Cleaning, Integration, Hypothesis Testing).
* **Visualization:** Tableau (Interactive Dashboards & Geospatial Analysis).
* **Communication:** Presentation & Video Storytelling (YouTube).
* **Key Skills:** Data Transformation, Forecasting, and Translating Business Requirements into Actionable Insights.

## 📊 Data Sources
* **Influenza Deaths:** Geography, time, age, and gender (Source: **CDC**).
* **Population Data:** Geography & Demographics (Source: **US Census Bureau**).

## 📂 Key Analysis & Deliverables

### 1. Data Integration & Cleaning
* Merged CDC health data with Census demographic data to identify high-risk regions.
* Conducted **Statistical Hypothesis Testing** to validate correlations between age groups (vulnerable populations) and flu severity.

### 2. Visual Analysis & Forecasting
* Developed interactive **Tableau Dashboards** to track seasonal trends and geographic "hotspots".
* Created a forecast model to predict peak weeks, allowing for proactive staffing recruitment.

### 3. Final Presentation
* **Youtube Project (https://youtu.be/nfGcE5Y54Gc) ** 🎥
* **Storytelling in Tableu <a href=https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/mafalda.antunes/viz/task2_9-Final/Story1> Project</a>)** 📈

## 🚀 Strategic Recommendation
The final report includes a month-by-month deployment schedule, prioritizing states with the highest density of vulnerable populations and historically high mortality rates.
