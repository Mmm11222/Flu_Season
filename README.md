# Flu_Season
The United States has an influenza season where more people than usual
suffer from the flu. Some people, particularly those in vulnerable populations, develop serious
complications and end up in the hospital. Hospitals and clinics need additional staff to
adequately treat these extra patients. The medical staffing agency provides this temporary
staff.

# Project Goal
To help a temporary medical staffing agency that covers all hospitals in each of the 50 states of the United States, to plan for the upcoming influenza season, as to adequately provide workers on an as-needed basis.
